`GooZoo – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-02-13

1. Introduction
GooZoo is a greeting app that helps you create and share a short message (text and/or audio) with an optional visual card. This Policy explains what information is handled by GooZoo and how your privacy is protected.

2. What GooZoo does
GooZoo helps you:
• Record or select a short greeting audio.
• Combine it with a decorative card and optional photo.
• Share your greeting using apps already installed on your phone (such as WhatsApp, Telegram, email, or other messengers).
GooZoo is not a social network. You choose what to create and who to share it with.

3. Data stored on your device
GooZoo does not require a GooZoo account and does not operate a cloud storage for your greetings.
Your created content (cards, audio, and optional photos) is stored locally on your device and/or inside the third-party app you choose when sharing.
Please protect your phone with a PIN, password, fingerprint, or another secure method.

4. Information we collect
GooZoo is designed to work mainly offline. We do not collect your greeting content, your contacts, or your private conversations.
We may receive limited technical information only in these cases:
• If the app crashes and your device/OS automatically provides a crash report (depending on your device settings), the report may include technical details such as device model, OS version, and crash stack traces.
• If you contact support, you may choose to send diagnostic details (for example screenshots or logs) to help us investigate a problem.
We use such information only to fix bugs and improve stability.

5. Permissions used by the app
Depending on how you use GooZoo, the app may request:
• Microphone permission – to record audio greetings.
• Photos/Media (or Storage) permission – to select or save photos and greeting files.
• Network access – only when you open external pages from inside the app (for example a translation web page or the Google Play page).
You can manage permissions in your phone’s system settings. Denying a permission may limit related features.

6. Sharing with other apps
When you share a greeting, GooZoo uses your phone’s standard share system:
• You choose the target app and recipient.
• After sharing, the third-party app’s privacy and security practices apply.
We cannot control how third-party apps store or process your data. Please review their privacy policies.

7. Children and families
GooZoo is intended to be family-friendly. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
Parents and guardians are responsible for supervising how children use the app and which apps they use for sharing.

8. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the app, but no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.
Because GooZoo stores content locally and does not upload it to our servers, your device security plays an important role. We recommend keeping your device locked and using trusted sharing apps.

9. Changes to this Policy
We may update this Policy to reflect new features or legal requirements. When the Policy changes, the updated version will be shown in the app with a new “Last updated” date.

10. Contact
